Visualization of Restaurant Health Scores in and around San Francisco, CA, USA.

This visualization is built using Leaflet.js, and is supported by Open Street and Google base maps. By utilizing a combination of Leaflet plugins and Google services, clusters of restaurants are depicted by a set of color markers and customized popups from Font Awesome and Leaflet Awesome Markers. For each marker (onclick), a Google Street Map frame appears on the left with it's own embedded controls for easy viewing of the streets. 

The set of color markers are defined based on the four categories of data decided upon by the San Francisco Department of Heath. The Department issues health scores between 0 to 100 to each restaurant based on some criteria and also records the number of violations over the year.
